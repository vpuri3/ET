1. Purpose

This thorn implements a multigrid solver for systems of elliptic PDEs.
It uses Carpet to manage the different grids and the transfer of data
between them. The solver is generic -- the system of equations to solve
is defined at runtime by setting its coefficients via external grid
functions. 

Some examples are discussed in gr-qc/1305.5576.
