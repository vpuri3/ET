%
%  Thorn documentation in the latex file doc/documentation.tex
%  will be included in ThornGuides built with the Cactus make system.
%  The scripts employed by the make system automatically include
%  pages about variables, parameters and scheduling parsed from the
%  relevant thorn CCL files.
%
%  This template contains guidelines which help to assure that your
%  documentation will be correctly added to ThornGuides. More
%  information is available in the Cactus UsersGuide.
%
%  Guidelines:
%   - Do not change anything before the line
%       % START CACTUS THORNGUIDE",
%     except for filling in the title, author, date, etc. fields.
%        - Each of these fields should only be on ONE line.
%        - Author names should be separated with a \\ or a comma.
%   - You can define your own macros, but they must appear after
%     the START CACTUS THORNGUIDE line, and must not redefine standard
%     latex commands.
%   - To avoid name clashes with other thorns, 'labels', 'citations',
%     'references', and 'image' names should conform to the following
%     convention:
%       ARRANGEMENT_THORN_LABEL
%     For example, an image wave.eps in the arrangement CactusWave and
%     thorn WaveToyC should be renamed to CactusWave_WaveToyC_wave.eps
%   - Graphics should only be included using the graphicx package.
%     More specifically, with the "\includegraphics" command.  Do
%     not specify any graphic file extensions in your .tex file. This
%     will allow us to create a PDF version of the ThornGuide
%     via pdflatex.
%   - References should be included with the latex "\bibitem" command.
%   - Use \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract} instead of \abstract{...}
%   - Do not use \appendix, instead include any appendices you need as
%     standard sections.
%   - For the benefit of our Perl scripts, and for future extensions,
%     please use simple latex.

\begin{abstract}
This thorn implements a multigrid solver for systems of elliptic
partial differential equations. It uses \texttt{Carpet}'s
interface to handle loops over the grid hierarchy and pass 
information between different components. The system of equations
is passed to the solver via parameters pointing to the external
grid functions that hold the equation coefficients.

\section{Introduction}
\texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} is a Cactus thorn that implements a multigrid
solver for elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The implementation
is rather standard, and it also allows for local AMR grids
(in which case it uses a rudimentary \emph{multilevel} algorithm).

This thorn requires \texttt{Carpet}, which it uses to manage the 
access to the grid structure (via the \texttt{BEGIN\_*\_LOOP} and 
\texttt{END\_*\_LOOP} macros) and to pass information between the 
different levels (via the restriction and prolongation operators).

Structurally, the solver can tackle any type of equation or system
of equations, their coefficients being passed to \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} 
via string parameters holding the names of the corresponding grid 
function. The thorn comes with a number of test cases which should 
be easy to customize and extend.

\section{Principle of multigrid}
Multigrid schemes are designed to solve elliptic equations on a 
hierarchy of grids, with the goal of speeding up the convergence 
rate of relaxation algorithms (such as Gauss-Seidel) by eliminating
different frequency modes of the solution error on different grids.
It is known that relaxation techniques are very effective at 
eliminating the high-frequency part of the error; when solving an 
elliptic PDE on a grid, it is then advantageous to relax it on a 
coarser grid beforehand and interpolate the result back onto the
original grid. Complex schemes involving several grid levels, each
with a different PDE, can be designed to maximize the speed up.
Please refer to~\cite{Briggs:2000fk} for the details.

\section{Using This Thorn}
\texttt{CT\_MultiLevel}, along with the rest of the \texttt{Cosmology}
arrangement, is released under the General Public License, version 2
and higher. The copyright of this thorn remains with myself.

\subsection{Obtaining This Thorn}
\texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} is publicly available in COSMOTOOLKIT's git 
repository:
\begin{verbatim}
   git clone git@bitbucket.org:eloisa/cosmotoolkitpub.git 
\end{verbatim}
A helper thorn \texttt{CT\_Analytic} is available under the same repository.

\subsection{Basic Usage}
In order to solve an elliptic PDE with \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel},
\texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} can be simply compiled in, with the 
requirement that \texttt{Carpet} is compiled as well. The thorn 
also inherits from \texttt{boundary} and \texttt{grid} for boundary 
APIs and coordinate labels.

Currently, the equation is solved in a single schedule call at 
\texttt{CCTK\_INITIAL}, in \texttt{GLOBAL\_LATE} mode (to ensure
that necessary objects such as the grid arrays have been populated).

As the equation coefficients will be set by grid functions, a thorn
allocating and setting these grid functions to the desired values
has to be included. Another thorn in the \texttt{Cosmology} arrangement,
\texttt{CT\_Analytic}, serves this purpose. Grid functions of other
origin are naturally just as good.

Each equation in the system to solve is parametrized as
follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
c_{xx} \partial_{xx} \psi + c_{xy} \partial_{xy} \psi + c_{xz} \partial_{xz} \psi + 
c_{yy} \partial_{yy} \psi + c_{yz} \partial_{yz} \psi + c_{zz} \partial_{zz} \psi &+& \\
c_{x} \partial_{x} \psi + c_{y} \partial_{y} \psi + c_{z} \partial_{z} \psi +
c_{0} \psi^{n_0} + c_{1} \psi^{n_1} + c_{2} \psi^{n_2} + c_{3} \psi^{n_3} + c_4 \psi^{n_4} &=& 0
\end{eqnarray}
All the coefficients $c_*$ and the powers $n_*$ can be specified by
setting the parameters \texttt{*\_gfname[*]} to the desired grid 
function name. These parameters are arrays to allow for the solution 
of systems of equations.

The only other parameter which must be set to ensure correct 
operation is \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel::topMGlevel}, which tells the
solver which is the finest refinement level that covers the entire
domain in which the equation is to be solved. All levels below and
including this will be used in the classical multigrid sense
(e.g., in a V- or FMG-cycle). The ones above will be treated as
local AMR boxes, and be solved via a multilevel prescription; 
presently, this involves simply interpolating the solution from
the \texttt{topMGlevel} refinement level at the end of the 
multigrid part and relaxing it progressively, from coarser to 
finer, on all the local grids. 

Other parameters control the stopping criteria (numbers of 
relaxation sweeps and residual tolerance), the finite-differencing 
order used to discretized the equation, the number of equations
in the system, and whether the solution error should be calculated
(this obviously requires the exact solution to be known and
stored in a grid function, its name passed to \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel}
via the usual parameter mechanism).

Concrete examples on how to set these parameters are provided
below.

\subsection{Special Behaviour}
When the equation coefficients cannot be passed in via external
grid functions (as is the case, for instance, when solving a
coupled system of PDEs), then one can resort to auxiliary functions,
which are recalculated after each relaxation sweep. The actual
algorithm used to populate these coefficient has to be provided
by the user; some examples are provided under \texttt{src/auxiliaries}.
These values are stored in \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel}'s \texttt{auxiliaries}
variable group.

All coefficients, auxiliaries, and other useful grid functions are
stored in the pointer structure \texttt{coeffptr}, to which the user
can further append pointers to extra external grid functions, which 
are not used as PDE coefficients (and thus do not need additional 
storage space and shouldn't be introduced as auxiliaries), but are 
still needed by the solver. Examples can be found under 
\texttt{src/extra}.
 
Finally, if variable resetting is necessary after each relaxation
step (for instance, when solving linear problems in periodic domains),
a suitable calculation needs to be provided by the user, similar to
the examples in \texttt{src/integral}.

\subsection{Interaction With Other Thorns}
\texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} uses some of \texttt{Carpet}'s macros to
access different components of a grid hierarchy, and its prolongation
and restriction operators to pass information between them.

Furthermore, \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} needs at least one external
thorn to set the PDE coefficients. The helper thorn \texttt{CT\_Analytic}
can be used to this purpose, but any set of external grid functions 
will serve the purpose.

\subsection{Examples}
The solver is described in~\cite{Bentivegna:2013xna}, along with a number
of examples. I rediscuss some of those below from the technical
standpoint, highlighting which parameters need to be set in each case
and whether other information is required from the user.

\subsection{Poisson's equation}
Poisson's equation reads:
\beq
\Delta \psi + \rho = 0
\eeq
where $\rho$ is a known source function and $\psi$ is an unknown
to solve for. Its Laplacian, $\Delta \psi$, simply represents the
sum of its diagonal second-order derivatives:
\beq
\Delta \psi = \partial_{xx} \psi + \partial_{yy} \psi + \partial_{zz} \psi
\eeq
so that \texttt{cxx\_gfname[0]}, \texttt{cyy\_gfname[0]} and \texttt{czz\_gfname[0]}
all have to be set to one. The source term can be specified freely.
\texttt{CT\_Analytic} can be used to set all coefficients, e.g. 
setting the \texttt{CT\_Analytic::free\_data} parameter to \texttt{exact}, 
where the coefficients of the diagonal second-order derivatives are
all one, the source term can be set to a linear combination of a
gaussian, a sine, and a $1/r$ term, and all the other coefficients
default to zero. To choose a gaussian source term, for instance, one
can set:
\begin{verbatim}
CT_Analytic::free_data             = "exact"
CT_Analytic::ampG                  = 1
CT_Analytic::sigma                 = 0.5
\end{verbatim}
and then pass the relevant grid functions to \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel}:
\begin{verbatim}
CT_MultiLevel::cxx_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testcxx"
CT_MultiLevel::cyy_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testcyy"
CT_MultiLevel::czz_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testczz"
CT_MultiLevel::c0_gfname[0]        = "CT_Analytic::testc0"
CT_MultiLevel::n0[0]               = 0
\end{verbatim}
\texttt{CT\_Analytic} can also be used to set the initial guess for
the solver:
\begin{verbatim}
CT_MultiLevel::inipsi_gfname[0]    = "CT_Analytic::testinipsi"
\end{verbatim}
Any coefficient that is not specified explicitly via a parameter 
will be initialized to zero.

Other parameters can be used to tune the solver's behavior, 
including the cycling mode through the different levels and the
stopping criterion. The parameter file \texttt{par/poisson.par}
provides a concrete example.

\subsection{The Einstein constraint system for a spherical distribution of matter}
Let's consider Einstein's constraints in the Lichnerowicz-York form
and in a conformally-flat space, 
i.e. a coupled system of four PDEs for the four functions $\psi$ and 
$X_i$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:CTT}
 \Delta \psi - \frac{K^2}{12}\,\psi^5 + \frac{1}{8} {A}_{ij} {A}^{ij} \psi^{-7} = - 2 \pi \rho \psi^5 \\
 \Delta X_i + \partial_i \partial_j X^j - \frac{2}{3} \psi^6 \delta^{ij} \partial_i K = 8 \pi j^i \psi^{10}
\end{eqnarray} 
where
\beq
A_{ij}=\partial_i X_j + \partial_j X_i + \frac{2}{3} \; \delta_{ij} \partial_k X^k
\eeq
and $K$, $\rho$ and $j^i$ are freely specifiable functions.

Due to conformal flatness, again $\Delta = \partial_{xx} + \partial_{yy} 
+ \partial_{zz}$. However, in this case we have the additional
complication that the coefficient of the $\psi^{-7}$ term in the
first equation depends on $X^i$, and therefore has to be updated
during the solution process. This is accomplished by storing this 
coefficient in an auxiliary function, filled by the function
\texttt{CT\_SetAuxiliaries} initially and after each Gauss-Seidel 
iteration. The recipe to fill this grid function is contained in
\texttt{src/auxiliaries/Lump.cc}.

The parameter specification for this case is then:
\begin{verbatim}
CT_Analytic::free_data             = "Lump"
CT_Analytic::Kc                    = -0.1
CT_Analytic::ampG                  = 1
CT_Analytic::ampC                  = 1
CT_Analytic::ampV                  = 0.1
CT_Analytic::sigma                 = 0.2
CT_Analytic::vecA                  = 0.6
\end{verbatim}
which specifies the equation coefficients and the free data 
$K$, $\rho$ and $X^i$, and:
\begin{verbatim}
CT_MultiLevel::inipsi_gfname[0]    = "CT_Analytic::testinipsi"
CT_MultiLevel::cxx_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testcxx"
CT_MultiLevel::cyy_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testcyy"
CT_MultiLevel::czz_gfname[0]       = "CT_Analytic::testczz"
CT_MultiLevel::n0[0]               = 5
CT_MultiLevel::c0_gfname[0]        = "CT_Analytic::testc0"
CT_MultiLevel::n1[0]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c1_gfname[0]        = "CT_Analytic::testc1"
CT_MultiLevel::n2[0]               = -7
CT_MultiLevel::c2_gfname[0]        = "CT_MultiLevel::ct_auxiliary[0]"

CT_MultiLevel::inipsi_gfname[1]    = "CT_Analytic::testinixx"
CT_MultiLevel::cxx_gfname[1]       = "CT_Analytic::testcxx"
CT_MultiLevel::cyy_gfname[1]       = "CT_Analytic::testcyy"
CT_MultiLevel::czz_gfname[1]       = "CT_Analytic::testczz"
CT_MultiLevel::n0[1]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c0_gfname[1]        = "CT_Analytic::testc2"
CT_MultiLevel::n1[1]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c1_gfname[1]        = "CT_MultiLevel::ct_auxiliary[1]"

CT_MultiLevel::inipsi_gfname[2]    = "CT_Analytic::testinixy"
CT_MultiLevel::cxx_gfname[2]       = "CT_Analytic::testcxx"
CT_MultiLevel::cyy_gfname[2]       = "CT_Analytic::testcyy"
CT_MultiLevel::czz_gfname[2]       = "CT_Analytic::testczz"
CT_MultiLevel::n0[2]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c0_gfname[2]        = "CT_Analytic::testc3"
CT_MultiLevel::n1[2]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c1_gfname[2]        = "CT_MultiLevel::ct_auxiliary[2]"

CT_MultiLevel::inipsi_gfname[3]    = "CT_Analytic::testinixz"
CT_MultiLevel::cxx_gfname[3]       = "CT_Analytic::testcxx"
CT_MultiLevel::cyy_gfname[3]       = "CT_Analytic::testcyy"
CT_MultiLevel::czz_gfname[3]       = "CT_Analytic::testczz"
CT_MultiLevel::n0[3]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c0_gfname[3]        = "CT_Analytic::testc4"
CT_MultiLevel::n1[3]               = 0
CT_MultiLevel::c1_gfname[3]        = "CT_MultiLevel::ct_auxiliary[3]"
\end{verbatim}
which informs \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel} on the grid functions holding
the coefficients and on the existence of auxiliary functions.

Further parameters control other aspects of the solution, and can be
found in \texttt{par/constraints\_spherical.par}. In particular, the
parameter \texttt{CT\_MultiLevel::number\_of\_equations} has to be set
explicitly to four to accomodate the full system of equations.
